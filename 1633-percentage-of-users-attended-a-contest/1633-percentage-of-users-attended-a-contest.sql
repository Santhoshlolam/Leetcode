Explanation: 
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%   */


select contest_id,round(count(distinct user_id) * 100 /(select count(user_id) from Users) ,2)  as percentage from Users natural join Register group by contest_id order by percentage desc,contest_id;
